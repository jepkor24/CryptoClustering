# CryptoClustering
*Find the Best Value for k by Using the Original Data* 
- Code the elbow method algorithm to find the best value for k. Use a range from 1 to 11. 

- To visually identify the optimal value for k, plot a line chart of all the inertia values computed with the different values of k. 
- What’s the best value for k? 

*Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means by Using the Original Data* 

- Initialize the K-means model with four clusters by using the best value for k. 
- Fit the K-means model by using the original data. 
- Predict the clusters for grouping the cryptocurrencies by using the original data. Review the resulting array of cluster values. 
- Create a copy of the original data, and then add a new column of the predicted clusters.  
- Using hvPlot, create a scatter plot by setting x="price_change_percentage_24h" and y="price_change_percentage_7d". Color the graph points with the labels that you found by using K-means. Then add the crypto name to the hover_cols parameter to identify the cryptocurrency that each data point represents.   

*Optimize the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis* 
 - Create a PCA model instance, and set n_components=3. 
- Use the PCA model to reduce the features to three principal components. Then review the first five rows of the DataFrame. 
- Get the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component. 
- What’s the total explained variance of the three principal components?  

*Create a new DataFrame with the PCA data.*  
- Be sure to set the coin_id index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame. Review the resulting DataFrame. 
- Find the Best Value for k by Using the PCA Data
- Code the elbow method algorithm, and use the PCA data to find the best value for k. Use a range from 1 to 11. 
- To visually identify the optimal value for k, plot a line chart of all the inertia values computed with the different values of k. 
- What’s the best value for k when using the PCA data? Does it differ from the best value for k that you found by using the original data?  

*Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means by Using the PCA Data*  
- Initialize the K-means model with four clusters by using the best value for k. 
- Fit the K-means model by using the PCA data. 
- Predict the clusters for grouping the cryptocurrencies by using the PCA data. Review the resulting array of cluster values. 
- Create a copy of the DataFrame with the PCA data, and then add a new column to store the predicted clusters. 
- Using hvPlot, create a scatter plot by setting x="PC1" and y="PC2". Color the graph points with the labels that you found by using K-means. Then add the crypto name to the hover_cols parameter to identify the cryptocurrency that each data point represents. 

*Visualize and Compare the Results*
- Create a composite plot by using hvPlot and the plus sign (+) operator to compare the elbow curve that you created from the original data with the one that you created from the PCA data.
- Create a composite plot by using hvPlot and the plus (+) operator to compare the cryptocurrency clusters that resulted from using the original data with those that resulted from the PCA data. 
- Based on visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what’s the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data by using K-means?
